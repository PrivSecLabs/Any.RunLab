# ANY.RUN

## Objective


The Malware Analysis Lab project designed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and analyzing cyber-attacks using the Any.Run sandbox.
This platform enabled in-depth visualization and analysis of real-time attacks, providing hands-on experience to enhance 
understanding of network security, attack behavior, and defensive techniques.


### Skills Learned


- Advanced understanding of malicious processes and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.


### Tools Used


- Any.Run for sandboxing environment and analysis.
- Malware samples for detonation in virtual environment.
- OSINT for hashes flagged as malicious by security vendors.
